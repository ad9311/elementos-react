# Elementos - React/Redux Microverse Capstone Project

> Elementos is a web-based application that allows you to explore periodic table elements. 

It features two pages, the home page, and the details page. On the first page, you'll see a list with all the periodic table elements. When you click on any element this will redirect you to the details page where more data will be available.
